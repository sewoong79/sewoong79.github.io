    <pre>Albert Einstein (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, but made contributions to quantum theory before 1920), Niels Bohr (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922, but made contributions to quantum theory before 1920), and Max Planck (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918) made contributions to quantum theory.

    </div>
</div>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Correct Answer: Several Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920 made significant contributions to quantum theory. Here are the laureates and their specific contributions:  1. **Max Planck (1918)** - Planck is considered the father of quantum theory. He introduced the idea of energy quanta and derived Planck&#39;s radiation law, which describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium.     2. **Albert Einstein (1921)** - Although awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921, Einstein made crucial contributions to quantum theory with his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of light.  3. **Niels Bohr (1922)** - Bohr received his Nobel Prize for his contributions to our understanding of atomic structure and radiation. His Bohr model of the atom incorporated quantum theory and explained how electrons could have stable orbits.  4. **Johannes Stark (1919)** - Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields (the Stark effect), both phenomena that provided insights into atomic structure and quantum mechanics.  5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925)** - Franck and Hertz&#39;s Nobel Prize was awarded for their experiments on electron impacts in atoms, which confirmed quantum energy levels within atoms.</p>
<p>Extracted Answer: Albert Einstein (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, but made contributions to quantum theory before 1920), Niels Bohr (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922, but made contributions to quantum theory before 1920), and Max Planck (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918) made contributions to quantum theory. Their respective contributions are: Albert Einstein: discovery of the photoelectric effect (published in 1905), Niels Bohr: work on atomic structure (published in 1913), and Max Planck: work on the theory of black-body radiation (published in 1900).</p>

    <pre>Since the turn of the 21st century, there has only been one year in which the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction has not been awarded. Among the finalists that year, one novel was published posthumously. The author of this posthumous publication is best known for a different novel published 15 years prior. The opening lines of this book later inspired a song by a band. The name of this band can be determined with the following calculation: find the age of the author on January 1 of the year the latter book was published, add four, and subtract the sum from the year this author was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. The name of this band was inspired by yet another book. What is the name of this book and its author?</pre>
